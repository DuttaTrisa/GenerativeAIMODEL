This code defines a Discriminator network for a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). 
In this code snippet, the Discriminator is a neural network that takes an input image 
(28x28 pixels) and outputs a single value indicating whether the input image is real
 or generated (fake).

The torch.relu function is the rectified linear unit activation function, which
 introduces non-linearity to the network by outputting the input directly if it is
  positive, otherwise, it outputs zero.

The torch.sigmoid function is another activation function used in the output layer 
of the Discriminator. It squashes the output between 0 and 1, providing a probability
 score indicating the likelihood that the input image is real (closer to 1) or
  generated (closer to 0) according to the Discriminator's learning.

In the GAN framework, the Generator and Discriminator are trained in an adversarial
 manner: the Generator tries to generate realistic images to fool the Discriminator,
  while the Discriminator aims to distinguish between real and fake images accurately.
   This competitive process helps both networks improve over time.
